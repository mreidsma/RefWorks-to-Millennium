#README - RefWorks to Millennium

---

This tool was developed by Matthew Reidsma in javascript/jQuery to add an export to RefWorks button at the end of the Title element in Millennium. It only adds the button to the 245 Title, not the Uniform or Alternate titles. It's easy to install and works in all browsers. It requires the Millennium ILS and the Encore discovery platform.

INSTALLATION

Upload the included javascript file and jQuery to Millennium's Web Master and include the following two lines in your botlogo.html file.

<script src="/PATH/TO/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="/PATH/TO/refworks2millennium.js"></script>
